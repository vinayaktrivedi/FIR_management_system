# FIR_management_system
A web interface to smoothly manage FIR system in police stations, based on PHP, and SQL. 
```Extra feature includes image matching of criminals and victims if they are unknown, and happen to present in already registered users in our system. If not found, they will be termed as unidentified, and later on whenever a new image of a person comes to database, it will matched against them to find their identities. ```
